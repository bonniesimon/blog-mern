# blog-mern
A full stack blog application I am making to learn the in's and out's of MERN stack.

## Setup

Note: Make sure you have nodejs installed on your system.
Type the following in the terminal to find out.
`node -v`


In the project folder:

- To run server:
```
cd server 
npm run dev
```

- To run client (React):

```
cd client 
npm start
```

### Environmental Variable:

These are things present in my .env that I've not included here for security reasons. 

- MONGO_URI

Go to mongo db atlas and get a URI (Just google)
Then replace MONGO_URI throughout the project with your URI key.

- ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

Simply create a random string in place of this throughout.
eg. : ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET =  dajfkjdsahfkjkf3434
